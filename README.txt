Open Source Overview
============================
DTALite AMS consist of the source-code and the compiled application used as part of the AMS (Analysis, Modeling and Simulation Testbeds for DMA and ATDM Evaluation) Phoenix Testbed. This Simulation Platform is used to simulate real world traffic demand within a given roadway network at a mesoscopic level. Individual vehicle agents are simulated with their trajectories tracked and recorded for performance measure analysis.


DTALite stands for Dynamic Traffic Assignment Lite.
